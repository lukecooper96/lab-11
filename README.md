## 70pt
Make the ball twice as large
Make the ball move 5 times faster

## 85pt
Make the ball bounce up and down instead of left and right

## 100pt
Make the ball "wrap" instead of bouncing - when it hits the right
edge of the window, it should reappear at the left side and continue moving
to the right.

Minus 5pts if your code has no comments

Minus 10pts if you only commit once to github
